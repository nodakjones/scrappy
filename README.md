# Contractor Data Enrichment System

*An AI-powered system for automatically validating, categorizing, and enriching contractor business data*

---

## Overview

The Contractor Data Enrichment System processes contractor license data to identify legitimate residential service providers in the Puget Sound region. The system validates contractors by finding and analyzing their business websites, then uses AI to categorize their services and determine if they serve residential customers.

**Key Features:**
- **Website Discovery**: Finds legitimate business websites using Google Search
- **Anti-Fraud Validation**: 5-factor confidence scoring prevents wrong business matches  
- **Geographic Filtering**: Focuses on Puget Sound region contractors (excludes eastern WA)
- **AI Categorization**: Analyzes websites to determine residential vs commercial focus

### Enhanced Discovery Features

**Simplified Search Queries**: The system uses 3 focused search strategies:
1. `"{full business name}" {city} {state}` - Exact business name with location
2. `"{simple business name}" {city} {state}` - Business name without LLC/INC with location  
3. `"{simple business name}" {state}` - Business name without LLC/INC with state only

**Business Name Simplification**: Removes common business designations (LLC, INC, CORP) while preserving important descriptive words like "CONSTRUCTION", "ELECTRIC", "REMODELING".

**Consolidated Logging**: Google search results are logged in a single, comprehensive entry showing the query, status, response keys, and result summary instead of multiple separate debug entries.

**Comprehensive Domain Filtering**: Excludes government sites (`.gov`, `.org`, `.codes`), directory sites, and social media platforms to focus on legitimate business websites.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Data Import**: Load contractor CSV data into PostgreSQL database
2. **Website Search**: Use Google Custom Search to find potential business websites
3. **Website Filtering**: Remove directories, social media, and listing sites
4. **Website Validation**: Apply 5-factor confidence scoring to ensure correct business
5. **AI Analysis**: Use OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to analyze website content and categorize business
6. **Quality Assessment**: Combine website and AI confidence scores
7. **Status Assignment**: Auto-approve high confidence, flag low confidence for manual review

## Website Confidence Scoring System

The system uses a **two-stage validation process** to ensure discovered websites actually belong to the correct contractor and are legitimate residential service providers.

### Stage 1: Website Validation (6-Factor System)

**Purpose**: Determine if the discovered website belongs to the correct contractor business.

**6-Factor Validation (0.20 points each, 1.2 maximum)**

**Factor 1: Business Name Match (0.20 points)**
- Exact business name found on website = 1.0 score
- Partial matches: 80%+ words = 1.0, 60%+ = 0.6, 40%+ = 0.3
- Removes common suffixes (LLC, INC, CORP) for better matching

**Factor 2: License Number Match (0.20 points)**
- Contractor license number found anywhere on website = 1.0 score
- Strongest validation factor when present
- Handles various formats (with/without asterisks)

**Factor 3: Phone Number Match (0.20 points)**
- **Normalized Matching**: Removes all non-digits (dashes, parentheses, periods, spaces) from both database and website content
- **Full String Match**: Matches the entire normalized phone number string (e.g., "2065551234")
- **Pattern Matching**: Looks for phone numbers with labels (Phone:, Tel:, Call:, Contact:)
- **Supports Multiple Formats**: (206) 555-1234, 206-555-1234, 206.555.1234, 2065551234
- **Minimum Length**: Requires at least 10 digits for valid phone number matching
- **Case Insensitive**: Converts both database and website content to lowercase for matching

**Factor 4: Principal Name Match (0.20 points)**
- **Case Insensitive Matching**: Converts both database and website content to lowercase
- **Word Boundary Matching**: Uses regex word boundaries to avoid partial matches
- **Individual Word Matching**: Matches individual words from principal name (minimum 3 characters)
- **Handles Variations**: Middle initials, suffixes, different formatting
- **Context Aware**: Looks for names in "About Us", contact sections, owner information

**Factor 5: Address Match (0.20 points)**
- Exact street number match = 1.0 score
- Partial credit for street name components
- Most effective for contractors with physical storefronts

**Factor 6: Domain Name Business Word Match (0.20 points)**
- **Business Word Extraction**: Extracts significant words from business name (filters out LLC, INC, CORP, etc.)
- **Domain Matching**: Counts how many business name words appear in the website domain
- **Scoring**: Each matched word = 0.10 points, maximum 0.20 points (2 words)
- **Examples**: 
  - "360 POWER LLC" ‚Üí "powercore360.com" = 0.20 (matches "360", "power")
  - "365 PLUMBING LLC" ‚Üí "365plumbingseattle.com" = 0.20 (matches "365", "plumbing")
  - "3 BRIDGES ELECTRIC" ‚Üí "3bridgeselectric.com" = 0.20 (matches "3", "bridges", "electric")

### Geographic Validation (During Discovery)

**CRITICAL ANTI-FRAUD PROTECTION**: Geographic validation happens during the website discovery phase, not as a penalty in the 5-factor validation.

**Websites are filtered out during discovery if:**
- No Puget Sound area codes found (206, 253, 360, 425) **AND**
- No local address references found (Seattle, Tacoma, Bellevue, etc.)

**Multi-Area Service Logic:**
- "Serving Seattle, Tacoma, and Spokane" = ‚úÖ **ACCEPTED** (includes local areas)
- "Serving Spokane and Yakima only" = ‚ùå **FILTERED OUT** (no local presence)

**Implementation Note**: Geographic validation is implemented in the website discovery methods (`enhanced_website_discovery`, `search_google_api`, etc.) to filter out non-local websites before they reach the 5-factor validation stage. The system also uses business name variations and consolidated logging for improved search accuracy.

### Website Validation Threshold

**Minimum 0.4 confidence required** (at least 2 factors must match) for website acceptance:
- **‚â• 0.4**: Website accepted, proceed to AI analysis
- **< 0.4**: Website rejected, continue searching other results

### Stage 2: AI Business Classification

**Purpose**: Analyze website content to determine business type, service categories, and residential focus.

**AI Analysis Components:**
- **Residential Focus Analysis** (40% weight): Keywords like "residential", "home", "family"
- **Contractor Service Analysis** (30% weight): Keywords like "plumbing", "electrical", "hvac"
- **Business Legitimacy Analysis** (20% weight): Keywords like "licensed", "insured", "certified"
- **Business Name Relevance** (10% weight): Business name appears in content

**AI Confidence Score**: 0.0-1.0 based on content analysis

---

## Combined Confidence Scoring

The system calculates a final confidence score that determines the contractor's processing status using a **two-stage validation process**.

### Confidence Calculation Process

**Stage 1: Website Discovery & Validation**
1. **Website Discovery**: Find potential websites using Google Search, Clearbit API
2. **Website Validation**: Apply 5-factor validation system (business name, license, phone, principal, address)
3. **Website Confidence**: 0.0-1.0 based on 5-factor validation results

**Stage 2: AI Classification (Only if Website Confidence ‚â• 0.25)**
1. **AI Analysis**: Analyze website content for business categorization using comprehensive crawling
2. **Classification Confidence**: 0.0-1.0 based on AI analysis of residential focus, service types, legitimacy

**Final Combined Formula:**
```
When Website Confidence ‚â• 0.25:
    Final Confidence = AI Classification Confidence (direct use)

When Website Confidence < 0.25:
    Final Confidence = Website Confidence (AI analysis skipped)
```

### Example Scenarios

## Manual Review Process

Contractors with `pending_review` status require manual validation before final approval.

### Review Workflow

1. **Query pending records**: Find contractors with `review_status = 'pending_review'`
2. **Review contractor details**: Examine confidence breakdown, website, and AI analysis
3. **Make decision**:
   - **Approve**: Set `review_status = 'approved'` for export
   - **Reject**: Set `review_status = 'rejected'` to filter out
   - **Modify category**: Update service category and approve

### Review Queries

**Find contractors needing review:**
```sql
SELECT business_name, website_url, confidence_score, mailer_category
FROM contractors 
WHERE processing_status = 'completed' 
  AND review_status = 'pending_review'
ORDER BY confidence_score DESC;
```

**Approve contractor:**
```sql
UPDATE contractors 
SET review_status = 'approved', 
    reviewed_by = 'admin_user',
    reviewed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE id = [contractor_id];
```

**Exported Statuses**: Both `approved_download` (auto-approved) and `pending_review` (manual review needed) contractors are exported together.

### Export Commands

```bash
# Export all ready contractors - both approved_download AND pending_review statuses
python scripts/export_contractors.py --exported-by "user_name"

# Export only previously unexported contractors (approved_download + pending_review)
python scripts/export_contractors.py --unexported-only --exported-by "user_name"

# Track an existing CSV file retroactively
python scripts/export_contractors.py --track-existing exports/file.csv --exported-by "user_name"

# Show export summary and statistics
python scripts/export_contractors.py --summary
```

### Export Database Fields

Each exported contractor gets marked with:
- `exported_at` - Timestamp of export
- `export_batch_id` - Links to export_batches table
- `marked_for_download` - Boolean flag (TRUE)
- `marked_for_download_at` - When marked for download

### Export Batches Table

Tracks each export operation:
- `batch_id` - Unique identifier
- `export_date` - When export occurred
- `exported_by` - Who performed the export
- `contractor_count` - Number of contractors in batch
- `file_path` - Path to generated CSV file

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **429 Rate Limit Errors**: Daily quota exceeded, wait until tomorrow
2. **API Key Issues**: Check Google API and OpenAI configuration
3. **Database Connection**: Verify PostgreSQL is running
4. **Processing Errors**: Check logs with `check_logs.py`

### Quota Management
The system automatically detects when the daily Google API quota (10,000 queries) is exceeded and gracefully stops processing.

**Quota Detection Strategy:**
- **Consecutive 429 errors**: 3+ consecutive 429 errors trigger quota exceeded detection
- **Automatic shutdown**: Processing stops immediately when quota exceeded
- **Daily reset**: Quota resets at midnight each day
- **Progress preservation**: Partially processed batches are saved

**Check Quota Status:**
```bash
# Check current quota usage and recommendations
docker-compose exec app python scripts/check_quota_status.py
```

**Quota Management Commands:**
```bash
# Check if quota exceeded before processing
docker-compose exec app python scripts/check_quota_status.py

# Process with quota monitoring (automatically stops if exceeded)
docker-compose exec app python scripts/run_parallel_test.py

# Check processing status after quota exceeded
docker-compose exec app python scripts/check_results.py
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check for errors
docker-compose exec app python scripts/check_logs.py

# Test API status
docker-compose exec app python scripts/test_google_api.py

# View recent processing
docker-compose exec app python scripts/show_processed_puget_sound.py
```

### Daily Processing (Recommended)
```bash
# Process 5000 ACTIVE Puget Sound contractors (daily batch)
docker-compose exec app python scripts/run_parallel_test.py

# Process with custom limits
docker-compose exec app python scripts/run_parallel_test.py --limit 1000 --processes 2

# Test with small batch
docker-compose exec app python scripts/run_parallel_test.py --limit 100 --processes 1
```

*This system helps identify legitimate residential contractors in the Puget Sound region through intelligent website validation and AI-powered categorization, ensuring high-quality lead generation for home service marketing.*
